Faster Whisper transcription with CTranslate2
faster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.

This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.

Requirements
Python 3.9 or greater
Unlike openai-whisper, FFmpeg does not need to be installed on the system. The audio is decoded with the Python library PyAV which bundles the FFmpeg libraries in its package.

GPU
GPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:

cuBLAS for CUDA 12
cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12
Note: The latest versions of ctranslate2 only support CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9. For CUDA 11 and cuDNN 8, the current workaround is downgrading to the 3.24.0 version of ctranslate2, for CUDA 12 and cuDNN 8, downgrade to the 4.4.0 version of ctranslate2, (This can be done with pip install --force-reinstall ctranslate2==4.4.0 or specifying the version in a requirements.txt).

There are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below.

Usage
Faster-whisper
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model_size = "large-v3"

# Run on GPU with FP16
model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")

# or run on GPU with INT8
# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="int8_float16")
# or run on CPU with INT8
# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cpu", compute_type="int8")

segments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5)

print("Detected language '%s' with probability %f" % (info.language, info.language_probability))

for segment in segments:
    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))
Warning: segments is a generator so the transcription only starts when you iterate over it. The transcription can be run to completion by gathering the segments in a list or a for loop:

segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")
segments = list(segments)  # The transcription will actually run here.
Batched Transcription
The following code snippet illustrates how to run batched transcription on an example audio file. BatchedInferencePipeline.transcribe is a drop-in replacement for WhisperModel.transcribe

from faster_whisper import WhisperModel, BatchedInferencePipeline

model = WhisperModel("turbo", device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
batched_model = BatchedInferencePipeline(model=model)
segments, info = batched_model.transcribe("audio.mp3", batch_size=16)

for segment in segments:
    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))
Faster Distil-Whisper
The Distil-Whisper checkpoints are compatible with the Faster-Whisper package. In particular, the latest distil-large-v3 checkpoint is intrinsically designed to work with the Faster-Whisper transcription algorithm. The following code snippet demonstrates how to run inference with distil-large-v3 on a specified audio file:

from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model_size = "distil-large-v3"

model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
segments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5, language="en", condition_on_previous_text=False)

for segment in segments:
    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))
For more information about the distil-large-v3 model, refer to the original model card.

Word-level timestamps
segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", word_timestamps=True)

for segment in segments:
    for word in segment.words:
        print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (word.start, word.end, word.word))
VAD filter
The library integrates the Silero VAD model to filter out parts of the audio without speech:

segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", vad_filter=True)
The default behavior is conservative and only removes silence longer than 2 seconds. See the available VAD parameters and default values in the source code. They can be customized with the dictionary argument vad_parameters:

segments, _ = model.transcribe(
    "audio.mp3",
    vad_filter=True,
    vad_parameters=dict(min_silence_duration_ms=500),
)
Vad filter is enabled by default for batched transcription.

Logging
The library logging level can be configured like this:

import logging

logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger("faster_whisper").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

Model conversion
When loading a model from its size such as WhisperModel("large-v3"), the corresponding CTranslate2 model is automatically downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub.

We also provide a script to convert any Whisper models compatible with the Transformers library. They could be the original OpenAI models or user fine-tuned models.

For example the command below converts the original "large-v3" Whisper model and saves the weights in FP16:

pip install transformers[torch]>=4.23

ct2-transformers-converter --model openai/whisper-large-v3 --output_dir whisper-large-v3-ct2
--copy_files tokenizer.json preprocessor_config.json --quantization float16
The option --model accepts a model name on the Hub or a path to a model directory.
If the option --copy_files tokenizer.json is not used, the tokenizer configuration is automatically downloaded when the model is loaded later.
Models can also be converted from the code. See the conversion API.

Load a converted model
Directly load the model from a local directory:
model = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("whisper-large-v3-ct2")
Upload your model to the Hugging Face Hub and load it from its name:
model = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("username/whisper-large-v3-ct2")
Comparing performance against other implementations
If you are comparing the performance against other Whisper implementations, you should make sure to run the comparison with similar settings. In particular:

Verify that the same transcription options are used, especially the same beam size. For example in openai/whisper, model.transcribe uses a default beam size of 1 but here we use a default beam size of 5.
Transcription speed is closely affected by the number of words in the transcript, so ensure that other implementations have a similar WER (Word Error Rate) to this one.
When running on CPU, make sure to set the same number of threads. Many frameworks will read the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, which can be set when running your script:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 my_script.py
